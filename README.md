# IMDB Movie Analysis - Python Project üé¨üêç

## Overview üìù
This project investigates the factors that influence a movie‚Äôs success on IMDb using a rich dataset covering movies from 1920 to 2010. Implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook, the analysis involves extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. The goal is to understand what drives high IMDb ratings and to provide actionable insights for movie producers, directors, and investors.

## Project Description üìã
The dataset includes features such as genres, durations, languages, directors, budgets, and box office collections. The central question addressed is:

> **"What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDb?"**

### Approach:
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Remove unnecessary columns (e.g., Facebook likes, plot keywords, etc.)  
  - Eliminate blank/null cells and duplicate records  
  - Preprocess the data for accurate analysis  
- **Exploratory Analysis:**  
  - Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation) for IMDb scores by genre  
  - Use scatter plots (with trendlines) to examine the relationship between movie duration and IMDb score  
  - Analyze language distribution and director impact using pivot tables  
  - Explore budget and profitability relationships using correlation analysis  
- **Data Storytelling:**  
  - Present findings with charts and tables  
  - Apply the Five Whys technique to drill down into root causes of movie success

## Data Analysis Tasks & Key Insights üîç

### 1. Movie Genre Analysis
- **Task:** Calculate descriptive statistics for IMDb scores by genre.
- **Insight:**  
  - **Drama** is the most common genre, while **Western** movies are the least frequent.
  - Example stats: Mean = 533.27, Median = 401.5, Mode = 105, Variance ‚âà 248,269, Standard Deviation ‚âà 498.27.
- **Charts:**  
  - Bar charts and tables summarizing genre distributions and statistics.

### 2. Movie Duration Analysis
- **Task:** Plot a scatter chart of movie duration versus IMDb score, with a trendline.
- **Insight:**  
  - There is a weak association between movie duration and IMDb score, indicating that runtime is not a strong predictor of success.
  - Movies over 250 minutes show a minor chance of scoring in the 6‚Äì8.5 range.
- **Charts:**  
  - Scatter plot with an overlaid trendline.

### 3. Language Analysis
- **Task:** Tally movies by language and compute average IMDb scores.
- **Insight:**  
  - **English** movies dominate in number (3754 movies) and tend to receive the highest scores (up to 9.3).
- **Charts:**  
  - Pivot tables and bar charts displaying language distributions and corresponding IMDb performance.

### 4. Director Analysis
- **Task:** Group movies by director, calculate average IMDb scores, and identify top directors.
- **Insight:**  
  - Top directors include **Frank Darabont (9.3)**, **Francis Ford Coppola (9.2)**, **Christopher Nolan (9.0)**, among others.
- **Charts:**  
  - Pivot tables and bar charts highlighting directors‚Äô average scores.

### 5. Budget Analysis
- **Task:** Examine the relationship between movie budgets and profit margins.
- **Insight:**  
  - Movies with budgets over 200,000,000 tend to achieve higher profit margins.
  - The movie **AVATAR** shows the highest profit margin (523,505,847).
- **Charts:**  
  - Scatter plots and line/bar charts comparing budgets to profit margins.

> **Additional Insights:**  
> The HTML-exported Python notebook confirms these findings:
> - Genre distribution and descriptive statistics align with the Excel results.  
> - The weak correlation between duration and IMDb score is evident from the scatter plot trendline.  
> - The influence of top directors and language on movie ratings is validated by complementary charts.
